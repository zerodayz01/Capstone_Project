- I served as the backend developer and also contributed to front-end design in this collaborative capstone project aimed at helping college students explore and compare colleges.

- Using Python and the Flask framework, I built the backend to handle server-side logic and API interactions. Instead of using a local database, the application fetches live data directly from the College Scorecard API, ensuring users have access to the most up-to-date college information.

- For dynamic page rendering, I utilized Jinja, Flaskâ€™s templating engine, to generate HTML on the server side based on user inputs and API responses. On the front end, I designed the user interface with a focus on usability and responsiveness.

- To enhance interactivity, I integrated jQuery to handle AJAX requests and manipulate the DOM, allowing users to compare colleges and see updates without page reloads. This created a smooth, real-time user experience.

- My responsibilities included designing and implementing backend routes, managing API communication, parsing data, and serving it to the frontend. Additionally, I crafted the front-end layout, styles, and interaction patterns to ensure the application was intuitive and engaging for college students.

- This combined backend and frontend work resulted in a lightweight, efficient, and user-friendly application that delivers real-time data without local storage, making college research easier and more accessible.
